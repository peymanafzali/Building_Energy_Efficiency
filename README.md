# Building_Energy_Efficiency
In this code, the energy efficiency of a building is optimized in GAMS software. I investigated the impacts of lamps with different energy labels from Grade A to Grade G, high-efficiency home appliances, HVAC systems, sealing for air leakage, insulated windows and doors, building orientation, and natural light strategy on the energy efficiency of the building.
